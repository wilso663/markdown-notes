# Stephen Wilson - Note taking app

## Purpose
This app is meant to be a self directed exercise in 
1. Seeing what's new with React 18
2. A React refresher exercise as most of my recent projects have been in vanilla JS
3. Have a simple app, but something more complicated than a generic todo list

## General Use
[Repository](https://github.com/wilso663/markdown-notes)  
[Live Solution](https://wilso663.github.io/markdown-notes/)

Notes can be created with the plus icon on the sidebar and deleted by clicking the x icon next to the note in the sidebar
Users can
1) Write in the markdown window
2) Preview markdown text if they desire to have more advanced text formatting
3) Add markdown formatting by clicking the top menu bar, particularly if the user does not know how to write specific markdown flags for things like bold, italic, etc.

## Other Notes
While this app is meant for use on a desktop, it is responsive and will work on modern phone sizes and layouts
